# CISC 5520 Programming Languages Projects

This repository contains all four projects that I have worked on in relation to Programming Languages.

## Projects
- Project 1
  - Programming two programs one using procedural programming (C++), the other object-oriented programming (Python), solving the same problem that being, making calculations pertaining to the Solar System.
- Project 2
  - Programming an emulator in a functional programming language (F#) that is meant to replicate simple computer arithmetic and logical operations.
- Project 3
  - Programming in a logical programming language (Prolog) asking queries in relation to airline flights from and to various airports.
- Project 4
  - Designing a programming language from the ground up, how it would work with respect to Backus-Naur Form and how would the language look and work semantically and functionally.

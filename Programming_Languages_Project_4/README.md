# Project 4 Design your own language

## Requirements
- Presentation
  - Design Goals: What are the main goals you have in designing this language? (Readability, writability, reliability, cost), (High functionality, simplicity)
  - Targeted Domains: (Business, scientific, gaming, artistic, educational,...), (Highly secure, real-time, computationally intensive, front-end,...)
  - Targeted users: Domain experts, students, professional programmers
  - Type of language: (Compiled, interpreted), (Procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic,...)
  - Features: What differentiates your language from others?
  - Example Program: Show a simple program written in your language.

  - Example Program: Show a simple program written in your language.
  - Inspirations(s) (negative and/or positive): E.g. I wanted to have the real-world modelling capabilities of an object-oriented language, but without the potentially error prone use of inheritance and polymorphism, but where only one method per class can be designate to produce mutations.
  - Considerations: For each entry in your list of features explain the considerations you evaluated and made for how the feature will work 
  - Syntax: Using Backus-Naur Form (BNF) formally define the syntax of 5 major statements/constructs of your language. 
    - For loop
    - If-then-else
    - Function call
    - Statement
    - Declaration
    - Definition

## Setup Instructions:

1. Make sure that you are in the `Programming_Languages_Project_4` directory.

2. To run any `jan` language program, follow these steps:

  - Open a terminal:
    ```bash

    ```
  - Start the program by running the following:
    ```bash

    ```

3. To run the object-oriented program, follow these steps:

  - Open a terminal and start the program by running the following:
    ```bash
    python oop.py
    ```
